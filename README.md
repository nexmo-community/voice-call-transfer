# Call Transfer
This is an example of a  Call Transfer application built using the Nexmo Voice API, 

When users call your Nexmo number they will be places on hold and the call will appear on the main webpag, you can then connect each of those callers through to your number by clicking the button.

You can test out your own copy of this right now on heroku by clicking this button.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/nexmo-community/voice-call-transfer)

This will launch the heroku installer console, you will be asked to enter a name for your app (we need this twice) something like "FredsCallTransfer".
It will also ask you to enter your number where you want callers to be connected to, enter your number in internatonal format without the + eg `447790900123` 
It will also ask you for your nexmo API Key and Secret and finally it will ask you to enter a country where you would like to purchase a nexmo number.
